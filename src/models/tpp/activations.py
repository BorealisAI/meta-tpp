class Snake(nn.Module):
    '''
    Implementation of the serpentine-like sine-based periodic activation function:
    .. math::
         Snake_a := x + \frac{1}{a} sin^2(ax) = x - \frac{1}{2a}cos{2ax} + \frac{1}{2a}
    This activation function is able to better extrapolate to previously unseen data,
    especially in the case of learning periodic functions
    Shape:
        - Input: (N, *) where * means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Output: (N, *), same shape as the input

    Parameters:
        - a - trainable parameter

    References:
        - This activation function is from this paper by Liu Ziyin, Tilman Hartwig, Masahito Ueda:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08195

    Examples:
        >>> a1 = snake(256)
        >>> x = torch.randn(256)
        >>> x = a1(x)

            in_features: shape of the input
            a: trainable parameter
            trainable: sets `a` as a trainable parameter

            `a` is initialized to 1 by default, higher values = higher-frequency,
            5-50 is a good starting point if you already think your data is periodic,
            consider starting lower e.g. 0.5 if you think not, but don't worry,
            `a` will be trained along with the rest of your model
